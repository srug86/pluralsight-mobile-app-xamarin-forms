Xamarin.Forms is the preferred way for Microsoft developers to build applications that run on Android, iOS, and Windows. To use Xamarin.Forms for real applications that meet todayâ€™s requirements for flexibility and testability, you need to structure code according to industry-standard architecture guidelines. In this course, Building an Enterprise Mobile Application with Xamarin.Forms, you will learn how a real-life application is built with Xamarin.Forms. First, you will see a proposed architecture that promotes code-reuse as well as testability and maintainability. Next, you will learn how MVVM can be used in Xamarin.Forms. Then, you will create loose-coupling through messaging patterns and dependency injection, which are integrated in the proposed architecture. By the end of this course, you will have a good understanding of a real-life application architecture for Xamarin.Forms applications.
